# `embedded-driver-rs`

`embedded-driver-rs` serves some platform-agnostic drivers using the [`embedded-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) and [`embedded-hal-async`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-async) traits.
(driver meaning library crates that let a target platform interface an external device like a digital
sensor or a wireless transceiver).

`embedded-driver-rs` can support any number of target platforms (e.g. Cortex-M microcontrollers, esp32 microcontrollers, embedded Linux, etc.).
